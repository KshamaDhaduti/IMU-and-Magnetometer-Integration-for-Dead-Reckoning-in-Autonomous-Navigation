In this project, a navigation stack was built using GPS and IMU sensors for dead-reckoning in autonomous navigation. Data was collected by logging stationary and driving data using the device drivers for both sensors. The collected data was then analyzed, including magnetometer data for calibration, estimation of heading yaw, estimation of forward velocity, and dead reckoning with IMU. Python scripts and ROS (Robot Operating System) were used for the development and analysis of the project. The results showed the strengths and drawbacks of using IMU and magnetometer integration for accurate navigation in various conditions.
